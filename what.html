<h1>SO, WHAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE?</h1>


       <p1>Climate change (or global warming), <br>is the process of our planet heating up.
        <br>
        Scientists estimate that since the Industrial Revolution, <br>
        human activity has caused the Earth <br>
        to warm by approximately 1°C.<br>
        While that might not sound like much,<br> it means big things<br>
         for people and wildlife around the globe.
        <br>
        Unfortunately, rising temperatures 
        <br>don’t just mean that we’ll <br>
        get nicer weather – if only! <br>
        The changing climate will actually make our <br>
        weather more extreme and unpredictable. <br>
        As temperatures rise, some areas will get wetter <br>
        and lots of animals (and humans!) could find they’re 
        <br>not able to adapt to their changing climate.<br> 
        <br>
